State
    UI State
        Any data that supports the presenation logic of the application
        Highly UNLIKELY that this data might be needed in other parts of the application
        Feel free to keep this data in the component state

    Application State
        Any data that supports the core application logic
        Highly LIKELY that this data might be needed in other parts of the application
        DO NOT keep this data in the component state. Where?
